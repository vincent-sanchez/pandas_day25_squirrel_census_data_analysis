# 100 Days of Code | Day 25a | Pandas: Squirrel Census Data Analysis

main.py was created for Day 25 (Lesson 230) of the 100 Days of Code: Python course from Dr. Angela Yu. This version of the program uses the Pandas libaray to import data, group the data to perform and aggregate count of 'primary fur color', export the data to a CSV and then print the contents of the dataframe 'squirrel_count'.
